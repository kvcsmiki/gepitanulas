# MAPFEATURE Feature mapping function to polynomial features

#   MAPFEATURE(X1, X2) maps the two input features
#   to quadratic features used in the regularization exercise.
#
#   Returns a new feature array with more features, comprising of
#   X1, X2, X1.^2, X2.^2, X1*X2, X1*X2.^2, etc..
#
#   Inputs X1, X2 must be the same size
